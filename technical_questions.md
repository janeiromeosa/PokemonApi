1.  How long did I spend on this coding challenge?

    I timed myself to exactly 4 hours, using the timer on my phone.

    NOTE: I did some research before I started coding.- I did research on the sorting functionality and I also studied the API documentation.

2. What would I have added to my solutions if I was allotted more time?

    I would have :-
        i. finished unit testing the viewmodel and repository.
        ii. deleted the classes (code) that I wasn't using
        iii. modified the UI so that it would be even more appealing to user with focus on material design components.
        iv. added a descending sort functionality
        v. finished the handling for loading and error events.
        
    Thank you for the opportunity.
